Preprocessing Steps

1. Converting to dB values: SAR backscatter values are usually processed in deci-
bel scale for better dynamic range during processing. We initially attempted log-
arithmic conversion but later realized our dataset was already in dB format when
conversion produced abnormal results.

2. NaN cleaning: SAR images contain NaN (Not a Number) values, that are the
places(pixels) on sensor where no backscatter is received, primarily in shadowed re-
gions. We identified these null pixels and replaced them with the minimum intensity
value.

3. Speckle reduction: SAR imagery suffers from granular ”salt-and-pepper” noise
caused by coherent interference of the radar signals reflected from multiple scatterers
within a single resolution cell. We applied a 3×3 median filter that replaces each
pixel value with the median of its neighborhood, effectively smoothing the image
while preserving edges.

4. Normalization: Initial [0,1] scaling compressed the narrow dB range (-40dB to
-11dB) into near-zero values. We implemented percentile-based normalization (2-
98%) to redistribute intensities, enhancing separability between oil spills and ocean
surfaces for thresholding.

Thresholding : 
We manually did thresholding, by using skimage.filters library of python.We com-
puted adaptive threshold based on 32nd percentile of intensity.
