# Oil-Spill-Detection-using-SAR-Data
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an active remote sensing system that uses microwaves to generate high-resolution images regardless of light or weather. By transmitting polarized waves and analyzing backscatter, SAR can detect oil spills, which appear as dark patches where slicks dampen sea surface waves.
